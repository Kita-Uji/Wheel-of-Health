<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support systems represent the environment you operate within. From a physical point of view, it&rsquo;s everything from your office desk to how you stock your pantry. On a larger scale, its community, accountability structures, and the standards you&rsquo;re exposed to daily.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans adapt to their surroundings. Willpower alone is unreliable, but environments compound behaviour. The right systems reduce friction and raise your baseline without constant effort.</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rely entirely on self-discipline. Progress feels isolating and fragile. You feel everyone around you is against your greater goals, and your home environment is a minefield waiting to sabotage you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are supported, challenged, and reinforced by people and systems that expect more from you. Standards are clear, and you have cultivated a space designed to push you to success.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rise or fall to the standards of the room you spend time in. Behaviour is shaped less by intention and more by what is normalised around you.</span></em></p>
