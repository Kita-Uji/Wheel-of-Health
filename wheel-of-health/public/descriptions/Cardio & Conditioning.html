<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endurance represents your cardiovascular capacity and your ability to sustain effort without rapid fatigue. It governs how long you can physically and mentally operate before performance degrades.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endurance improves recovery between efforts, supports fat loss, strengthens heart health, and expands overall work capacity. A higher endurance base allows you to do more with less perceived effort, and recover faster when demands accumulate.</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You fatigue quickly, avoid conditioning, or feel limited during prolonged activity. Physical effort feels disproportionately taxing, leading to hesitation or avoidance.</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You recover quickly between efforts, maintain output over time, and don&rsquo;t fear exertion. Physical demands feel manageable rather than draining.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endurance determines whether effort feels sustainable or suffocating.</span></em></p>
