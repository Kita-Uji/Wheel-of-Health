<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purpose and mindset reflect your internal framework: clarity of direction, discipline, identity, and self-respect. This wheel governs </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you act, not just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you do.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">No plan survives contact with life without the right mindset. Motivation is fleeting. Identity and purpose are stabilising forces that carry behaviour through chaos, stress, and inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You drift between bursts of motivation and periods of burnout. Consistency depends on mood, circumstances, or external pressure. Progress is fragile.</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your habits align with who you are becoming. Discipline replaces reliance on motivation. Decisions are guided by identity rather than impulse.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mindset is your compass. Without it, effort still moves you but often in circles.</span></em></p>
