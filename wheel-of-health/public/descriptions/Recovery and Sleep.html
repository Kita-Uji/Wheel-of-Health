<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery is how well your body repairs itself after any bout of stress. Everything from working, eating, drinking, training, learning, and engaging in meetings incurs stress on the body. And here&rsquo;s the thing, the body doesn&rsquo;t care where the stress comes from, it just knows it&rsquo;s there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people still think that exercise is when they&rsquo;re burning fat and building muscle. This is false. Exercise is the stimulus. Recovery is where the results are built. Without it, effort turns into exhaustion. Failing to prioritise proper recovery not only blunts your health and fitness progress, but it hangs a perpetual fog over your mind, hampering productivity and impairing good judgment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poor sleep, constant soreness, irritability, and stalled progress even when &ldquo;doing everything right.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You bounce back quickly. Sleep is deep, stress is easily dissipated, and your body adapts instead of accumulating damage.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">If training is the blueprint and nutrition is the building material, sleep is the construction crew. Without it, nothing gets built.</span></em></p>
