<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These reflect how well your body and habits are designed to perform not just now, but across decades. This is about durability that is physical, metabolic, and behavioural.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short-term wins mean nothing if they compromise long-term health. The goal is not temporary performance, but sustained capability. A resilient system resists breakdown under time, stress, and accumulated load.</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You think reactively. You chase immediate results and address consequences later. Injuries, fatigue, and regression accumulate. You are collecting a more expensive medical bill for the future instead of investing in your health now.</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You train, eat, and recover with the future in mind. Strength, mobility, and health markers are preserved so independence and capability remain intact over time.</span></p>
