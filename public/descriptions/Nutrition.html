<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nutrition is the raw material your body is built from and sustained with. From macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fats, to micronutrients composed of vitamins and minerals. Every cell repair, hormone signal, and training adaptation depends on it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cannot out-train an inadequate fuel source. The right food doesn&rsquo;t just change your body composition. It dictates your energy, recovery, mood, and long term health markers..</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You fuel your body with poor, unsustainable choices. Meals are skipped, protein is inconsistent, calories are consumed erratically, and fat loss feels like guesswork. More importantly, your body is fighting against the things you consume leading to inflammation, insulin resistance, and worsening autoimmune symptoms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You fuel with precision and intent. Protein anchors your meals, portions are understood, and nutrition becomes a quiet advantage that keeps you ahead, not a daily mental battle. Eating out is a measured luxury you indulge in without sacrificing the needs ofyour body.&nbsp;</span></p>
