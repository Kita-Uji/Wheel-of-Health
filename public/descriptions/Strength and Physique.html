<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength and physique represent your body&rsquo;s capacity to produce force, resist force, and maintain its structure under load. This includes muscle mass, bone density, connective tissue integrity, and overall physical robustness. Aesthetics is an important factor of mental wellbeing and a show of a well maintained body. The sight of a healthy body is a great first impression for one&rsquo;s work ethic, mental health, and vigour.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength is the primary defence against injury, aging, and physical decline. It preserves independence, protects joints, and maintains metabolic health. A strong body absorbs stress more effectively both inside and outside the gym. Without sufficient strength, everyday tasks quietly become liabilities. A good physique on the other hand serves as a great external barometer for how well things are running underneath. You don&rsquo;t have to look like a superhero or bodybuilder, but having the right body composition is a great visual representation of your body fat levels and muscle mass.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You feel fragile, cautious, or disconnected from your body&rsquo;s potential. Movement feels tentative. Lifting, carrying, or exerting force feels risky rather than empowering. Over time, this breeds avoidance and accelerates decline. Visually, you avoid looking at yourself in the bathroom mirror whenever you can help it, causing resentment to brew.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You feel capable and physically confident. Your body responds when called upon. Lifting, carrying, and moving through life feels natural, controlled, and empowering and not something to fear. Visually, you stand with confidence and self certainly that carries into the way you navigate the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strength and physique are like a well-engineered building with a clean exterior. The internal framework bears the load, but the outward structure signals that everything beneath is sound. Cracks, sagging, or neglect on the outside usually reflect deeper structural issues within.</span></em></p>
