<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress is not the problem. Unregulated stress is. This portion can be further broken down into Tolerance , Fortitude, Resilience, and Adaptability (ToFoRA). Tolerance is how long you can endure stress. Fortitude determines the intensity of your behaviour change when a stressful situation gets to you. Resilience is how quickly you bounce back from the behaviour change. Adaptability is where you stand after a stressful period.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unmanaged stress raises fatigue, cravings, inflammation, and injury risk. This often takes a long time, which is why it goes largely unnoticed. It&rsquo;s also the biggest determinant of who can still inch forward on their health goals in difficult situations compared to the &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just start next week&rsquo; crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Low score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&rsquo;re constantly tense, reactive, or overwhelmed. Small setbacks feel big and you have no way to cope healthily. It almost feels like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>High score means:</strong><strong><br /></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">You stay composed under pressure. Stress still exists but it no longer controls your decisions. You may falter, but your coping mechanisms are not destructive, your rebound is measured, and you learn from these situations better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress is not the enemy. It is the forge that reveals whether your habits melt under heat or bolster your resolve.</span></em></p>
